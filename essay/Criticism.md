# Reason behind Western Criticism

Development projects have never been without their critics. Prominent academics like Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz, Arturo Escobar, and James Ferguson have critiqued development projects throughout the latter half of the 20th century. They pointed out how development projects are based in Western ideals and thought patterns, resulting in skewed power relations, economic dependencies of ‘developing’ countries on developed ones and how underlying West-centric assumptions tended to cause interventionist development projects to fail.  

The collection of development projects as large in scope as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will thus have its fair share of critics. However, two major factors differentiate this project from past projects of the late 20th century. Firstly, this is a development project initiated by the People’s Republic of China (PRC). It maintained a largely insular focus until the early 21st century, with its attention and involvement on the global stage largely restricted to economic and regional affairs. Thus, The BRI marks a break with this insular approach, committing to deepening the PRC's global reach and ties with countries as far flung as Latin America (Villar, 2023). Secondly, this project has attracted virulent criticism from prominent Western leaders, think tanks and political committees who accuse the PRC of using BRI development projects as a cover to economically exploit and gain strategic influence over the partner nations of the BRI.  

The first section of this chapter will examine the forms of criticism advanced by Western media in particular. The second section will evaluate how such criticisms of the BRI can, without much adjustment, be similarly applied to West-initiated development projects of the late 20th century, thereby calling into question the moral authority of the proponents of such criticism. The third section will propose reasons for these virulent criticisms by evaluating the link between the financing of development projects and geopolitical influence.  

## What Western Leaders and Media Criticise the BRI of

In its article “China's Growing Influence in Latin America”, the Council on Foreign Relations, a prominent think tank, implied that China ensnared countries like Venezuela in ‘debt traps’, lowered environmental and labour standards, and increased control over critical infrastructure, posing national security risks (Roy, 2023).  

Another article by the Center for Strategic & International Studies titled “ Combating Chinese Dual-Use Infrastructure: Bringing In the Private Sector'' suggests that Chinese funding of critical infrastructure projects serves a hidden agenda, with such infrastructure being potentially ‘dual use’ for military purposes (Berg, 2022).  

Another known proponent of criticism against China’s BRI is American governmental committees such as the United States – China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC). A 2021 report sent to Congress by them echoes the narrative that through the BRI, the PRC has hindered Latin America's development by increasing the region’s economic dependence on commodity exports and strategic investments that enhance its economic control. This engagement worsens environmental, social, and governance conditions by pressuring governments to compromise their laws and regulations to attract Chinese investment. The report further claims that the PRC exerted its economic and political influence to push its political agendas to the countries in Latin America, such as by attempting to use the provision of vaccines to pressure them to terminate diplomatic relations with Taiwan. (Bartholomew et al., 2021, p. 8).  

This highlights how American political organisations advance the narrative that China's development projects are detrimental to LAC countries, framing their criticisms as purely in the interest of these nations without acknowledging any potential ulterior motives.  

American political leaders are among the most influential critics of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Several senators and leaders have denounced the BRI, claiming it harms participating countries, including Latin America. National Security Advisor John Bolton in 2018 stated that the BRI is about advancing Chinese global dominance, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017 described Chinese infrastructure loans as ‘predatory’ economics, intended to lead to financing defaults and the conversion of debt to equity (Jones and Hameiri, p. 4).  

This sentiment has been further echoed by Senator Marco Rubio, who referred to China’s BRI projects as "glorified money pits." In a press release on 9 February 2023, he suggested that Ecuador was considering shutting down the Coca Codo Sinclair dam due to thousands of cracks and erosion damage to nearby communities. He further alleged that when economically fragile nations could not repay their debts, Beijing extorted concessions to expand its political and military influence. Rubio also stated that many Chinese companies contracted for international projects, including state-owned enterprises, have been implicated in numerous human rights violations throughout the BRI (Rubio, 2023).  

This narrative from American political leaders paints a picture of China as a coercive force, ostensibly benefiting the LAC region while also serving broader strategic interests.  

In conclusion, American think tanks, political organisations, and leaders have all criticised China’s Belt and Road Initiative, highlighting concerns about its impact on Latin America and the Caribbean. Think tanks like the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) emphasise political and economic risks. At the same time, the United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) focuses on security threats and economic dependencies. Prominent political figures have also reinforced this narrative, framing their criticisms as being in the best interest of LAC countries.  

However, such criticisms can almost similarly be directed against the actions of the US corporations, government and government-linked institutions like the Texaco-Gulf consortium, the Alliance for Progress, the IMF and the World Bank for their actions in Latin America in the mid-to-late 20th century, where it can be argued that their actions often placed American or Western geopolitical and economic interests before that of Latin America’s, and arguably were what led to Latin America’s debt crisis. The next section will examine such historical actions.  

## The West’s own track record in Ecuador and Latin America

The discovery of petroleum in Ecuador in 1967 by the US-domiciled Texaco Oil company led to the establishment of the Texaco-Gulf Consortium, mainly owned by Texaco and US-domiciled Gulf Oil. For the initial years between 1967 and 1974, the profit-sharing structure between the Texaco-Gulf consortium and Ecuador was heavily skewed in favour of the consortium, with Ecuador receiving royalties only at a relatively low rate of 11.5%. (Rochlin, 2011, p. 14). The consortium also made demands to the Ecuadorian government to lower the price per barrel of oil, and haggled over taxes paid by the consortium, demands that the Ecuadorian government regarded as bullying. Such demands were possible due to the consortium's leverage in terms of its knowledge, technical capacity and capital (Rochlin, 2011, p. 18).

The environmental damage left by Texaco’s operations was also eventually realised. An estimated 16.8 million gallons of oil were spilt from the trans-Ecuadorian Pipeline alone in 30 major incidents while Texaco was the operator. More than 3.2 million gallons of toxic wastewater were generated daily, virtually all dumped into the environment via unlined, open-air earthen waste pits, with no treatment or monitoring. Whilst such unlined pits had been discontinued throughout the USA by Texaco and other oil companies by 1972, such unlined pits continued to be used in Ecuador to save cost. To date, the ecological issues have not been resolved, with resistance by Chevron (having bought Texaco in 2000) in acknowledging Texaco’s culpability in the generated environmental damage. (Chevron/Texaco Case, 2014).  

The generation of petrodollars also encouraged Western banks to offer easy credit to the Ecuadorian government (Pablo & Andrade, 2016, p. 124). However, the decline in Ecuador’s petroleum boom by the mid-1980s and the sharp hike in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve in 1979 left Ecuador unable to service its debts, resulting in the greater Latin America Debt Crisis. When turned to for loans, the IMF demanded the implementation of neo-liberal policies, such as cutting government spending, opening the economy to foreign investors, lowering tariffs and raising taxes. (Endrizzi et al., 2023, p. 234). It can be argued that the IMF’s interest was to ensure Ecuador’s ability to repay its loans to the IMF and the Western commercial banks, with whom the IMF shared a close relationship (Ocampo, 2014, p. 21).

Ecuador’s compliance with IMF demands have hurt the Ecuadorian population in the late 1980s to early 1990s, as the cost of basic necessities rose with decreasing minimum wages. (Endrizzi et al., 2023, p. 224). In the meantime, the privatisation of Ecuador’s state companies and national resources allowed international capital to acquire them at low valuations (Endrizzi et al., 2023, p. 234).

A US financial aid and loan package was also set up in 1961 for Latin America, with the program dubbed the ‘Alliance for Progress’. However, this program came with strings attached. In return for US financial aid and loans, Latin American countries were expected to create comprehensive plans for national development, which would be reviewed and approved by an inter-American board of experts. The countries were also expected to establish democratic governments that could promote political stability and protect human rights. These thereby granted the US a degree of intervention in Latin American governments, serving US goals of ensuring influence over Latin America during a time of potential Soviet influence encroachment in the region. (Dunne, 2013, p. 1391).  

The West’s past actions in Ecuador thus open it up to much the same criticism they have directed against the BRI. It can be argued that Western companies like Texaco have likewise exploited Ecuador’s natural resources while ignoring and refusing culpability for their environmental impacts. The IMF's fiscal, monetary, and foreign investment policy advice can be argued to be made to ensure Ecuador’s ability to generate fiscal surpluses to pay back international capital whilst disregarding the impact of austerity policies on Ecuador’s population. Such advice can also be said to foster a pattern of public borrowing that perpetuated financial dependence, resulting in the 1980 Latin America debt crisis. This economic leverage was also parlayed into interference in the sovereignty of Latin American countries, as demonstrated by the Alliance for Progress program.  

## The underlying motives behind the criticisms by Western leaders

Thus far, it has demonstrated that the involvement of the US and the IMF in the financing and development of Ecuador was not necessarily benign, having performed much of the same activities that the West now criticises the BRI for doing. Whilst this duality in standards may be labelled as hypocrisy, this section also proposes that such criticisms are directed against the BRI precisely because the BRI’s development activities are similar to past Western activities. These past activities were designed to keep Latin America beholden to the US sphere of influence, and the BRI’s mimicry of such activities thereby posed a challenge to the domination of US influence over the Western Hemisphere.  

Since 1823, the US has articulated a foreign policy position (the Monroe Doctrine) that views the Western Hemisphere as the ‘backyard’ of the US, thereby opposing foreign power interference in the Western Hemisphere. As recently as March 2019, then US National Security Advisor John Bolton stated that the objective is “to have a completely democratic hemisphere”(Jativa, 2023).  

US influence in Latin American affairs took shape following the end of World War Two. Emerging as a global superpower, the US was in a prime position to influence political and economic affairs by implementing policies in line with an ideology now known as Modernization Theory. The theory holds that a developing society follows a predetermined sequence of stages, specifically the Western style of economic growth, technological advancement and political institutions. The US was cast as a prime example of a developed country whose developmental path was for developing countries to replicate. These ideological assumptions influenced American foreign policy, which hailed the American duty to intervene in the development of Latin American countries and to inculcate capitalism, democracy and free trade in return for American aid (Hendrickson, 1997, pp. 125-128).  

Latin America’s desire to industrialise in the style of Western technological advancements led it to develop an appetite for loans and budget deficits that the US and its linked organisation were willing to sustain. However, such loans from US-linked organisations ultimately served as policy leverage, as discussed earlier in this chapter, creating a power imbalance between Latin America and the US and ensuring the interventionist capabilities of the US. As long as governments followed the policies Washington and the multilateral lending agencies prescribed, Western loans would continue to finance chronic budgetary and balance-of-payment deficits (Kofas, 2001, p. 3).  

However, alternative financing from China allows Latin America to continue with their developmental goals whilst aiming for greater strategic autonomy and cohesion outside the influence of the US (Piccone, 2016, p.5). Before the formal inclusion of Latin America into the BRI in 2018, disillusionment with IMF-imposed neoliberal policies had already led to the ‘Pink Tide’ in Latin America, which saw a wave of leftist governments being elected  between the late 1990s and 2010s. In Ecuador, this contributed to the presidential election (2007-2017) of Rafael Correa, who made a point of pivoting Ecuador away from the influence of the United States, rolling back neoliberal policies, refusing further relationships with the IMF, and defaulting on its foreign debts. Correa voiced a desire for an alternative to the capitalist system, stating that his government was “building a conception of development that is different from that of the capitalist system, where we seek not to live better, to have competition, to have more every day, but to live well, to satisfy basic needs, where harmony with nature is sought, where we seek the indescribable life of cultures” (Semana, 2020).  

The availability of Chinese financing undoubtedly played a role in emboldening Rafael Correa’s and other similar leftist governments to reject political and economic intervention that they would otherwise be pressured to pursue. Such an availability of alternative financing thereby poses a threat to the economic and geopolitical leverage the US possessed over the Latin American countries.  

The motivation behind Western criticism of the BRI thus can be attributed to the West’s recognition of the geopolitical risk posed by the PRC, which pursued the same strategies that the West had used to gain influence and leverage in Latin America. A similar line of thought can be extended to BRI projects in regions like Southeast Asia, where the US and its ally Japan have also traditionally wielded influence through their role as financiers of large-scale infrastructure projects. As in Latin America, introducing the BRI has led to competition for geopolitical influence between the US, Japan, and the PRC under the veneer of financing development projects.
