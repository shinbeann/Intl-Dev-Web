## Quality Scandal

Following its launch in November 2019, the plant has been surrounded by international controversy, specifically questions regarding the materials' quality and the appearance of thousands of fissures within the plant’s distributors that connect water to the turbines to generate electricity. Not long after its construction, workers and engineers in the plant uncovered an alarming amount of cracks within the dam’s piping system. The presence of these defects catalysed a deeper investigation into the quality of the construction materials used in making the dam, questioning the building standards of Sinohydro. 2018, after two years of CCSHP operation, 171 unaddressed defects by Sinohydro were found. Additionally, 7,648 cracks and micro fissures were found in the water distributors in the plant’s machinery room. A final report in 2019 indicated that the cracks resulted from Sinohydro's use of unauthorised materials and their failure to follow proper technical procedures for welding the identified faults in 2014 (The People’s Map of Global China, 2022).  

Before the launch, the project also suffered from multiple technical difficulties. In December 2014, 25 workers stood on a temporary platform when an avalanche of water and construction material burst through the pipe. The platform gave way and fell, killing 13 people (13 Ecuadorians and 3 Chinese) and injuring another 12 (Times, n.d.). In 2018, three of the eight-generation units were not operational due to significant disconnections in the system. Furthermore, multiple Ecuadorian cities experienced power outages due to transmission line outages, and the shortfall in electricity had to be made up for by two other dams (Minas San Francisco and Delsitanisagua).

## Environmental Degradation

Moreover, the CCSHP has brought about numerous environmental threats, such as heavy erosion events, changes in ecological water flows, and the drying up of Ecuador’s famous San Rafael waterfall. Environmental specialists and geologists warned that the project’s over-dimensions and lack of comprehensive accountability for the surrounding environment would severely impact the local ecosystem. Critics raised concerns about the project’s ability to deliver the promised energy production, especially since the river has a lower flow rate than anticipated, coupled with sedimentation and seismic risks. The project is also faulted for impacting the last intact roadless zone in the Tropical Andes and the UNESCO Sumaco Biosphere Reserve. Due to the project's construction, new roads and transport infrastructure will require the further deforestation of surrounding land, leading to further environmental degradation. In February 2020, the collapse of the San Rafael Waterfall was attributed to accelerated regressive erosion in the Coca River, which inadvertently altered the behaviour of the natural dynamics of the Coca River (Hoffner, 2020). Coupled with increasingly intense and expansive anthropogenic activities in the region, the regressive erosion escalated, leading to the unfortunate loss of roads, bridges, housing complexes and infrastructure in strategic sectors (Ecuador’s most spectacular waterfall threatened by Chinese-funded Hydroelectric Project, n.d.).  

Furthermore, scientists are concerned about the effects that the erosive processes could have on the local freshwater fish and macroinvertebrates. According to the IUCN Red List of endangered species, many of the river’s species have been lost in the last 30 years and are facing further endangerment due to the construction of the CCSHP. This also impacts the locals, who depend on fish for their protein. The absence of fish in the river could lead to the hunting of monkeys for separate food sources (Lievano, 2023).  

## Social Conflict

Unlike other mega-dam projects, the CCSHP did not lead to the displacement of locals or the infringement of indigenous rights. Nonetheless, that is not to say that no social issues were reported. The dam's construction has indirectly impacted the local communities and their daily needs. Due to the dam's erosive effects and the diversion of the river’s flow, the locals are facing declining agricultural production, livestock, and fishing activities.  

Despite creating employment opportunities at the power plant and boosting the local economy during the dam's construction, the CCSHP's economic sustainability is questionable. Once the dam became fully operational with construction works completed, the local economy experienced a slowdown, and unemployment in the region increased (The People’s Map of Global China, 2022).  

Following this, the Ecuadorian Government provided aid by compensating the locals and spurring local development through various small-scale projects. These included “training and employment programs, electrification works, sewerage services, waste treatment, education and employment programs” (The People’s Map of Global China, 2022). However, critics argue that the government could do more with the remaining budget allocated for these programs, with potential comprehensive development projects that would bring about direct economic impacts not being fulfilled.  

## Conclusion

Sinohydro and the Chinese Government are currently focused on repairing their reputation in this matter, which might lead to them taking control of Ecuador’s CCSHP. Discussions surrounding the possibility of Ecuador concessioning the power plant to Sinohydro began in November 20222. If the deal goes through, Sinohydro will manage and operate the plant, conducting the necessary maintenance and repair work required for the plant to be fully operational. However, this move by the government has sparked debate amongst Ecuadorians, with locals expressing their fear of increased electricity costs and the privatisation of essential infrastructure. In February 2024, Ecuador’s Foreign Minister said that the possibility of the concession still stands. Hence, the terms of the deal negotiated, including the price of the concession, its duration, and the price of electricity that will be sold back to Ecuador, are of prime importance.  

Rather than focusing on China’s geopolitical aims, the debate surrounding this project should focus on achieving the best possible outcome for the benefit of the Ecuadorian public. Suppose a deal that can satisfy both parties and Ecuadorians is made. In that case, critics should observe the terms of the deal and how it can best accommodate Ecuador, avoiding misconceptions of a debt trap narrative.
