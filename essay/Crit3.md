<!-- ## The West’s track record in Ecuador and Latin America -->

The discovery of petroleum in Ecuador in 1967 by the US-domiciled Texaco Oil company led to the establishment of the Texaco-Gulf Consortium, mainly owned by Texaco and US-domiciled Gulf Oil. For the initial years between 1967 and 1974, the profit-sharing structure between the Texaco-Gulf consortium and Ecuador was heavily skewed in favour of the consortium, with Ecuador receiving royalties only at a relatively low rate of 11.5%. (Rochlin, 2011, p. 14). The consortium also made demands to the Ecuadorian government to lower the price per barrel of oil, and haggled over taxes paid by the consortium, demands that the Ecuadorian government regarded as bullying. Such demands were possible due to the consortium's leverage in terms of its knowledge, technical capacity and capital (Rochlin, 2011, p. 18).

The environmental damage left by Texaco’s operations was also eventually realised. An estimated 16.8 million gallons of oil were spilt from the trans-Ecuadorian Pipeline alone in 30 major incidents while Texaco was the operator. More than 3.2 million gallons of toxic wastewater were generated daily, virtually all dumped into the environment via unlined, open-air earthen waste pits, with no treatment or monitoring. Whilst such unlined pits had been discontinued throughout the USA by Texaco and other oil companies by 1972, such unlined pits continued to be used in Ecuador to save cost. To date, the ecological issues have not been resolved, with resistance by Chevron (having bought Texaco in 2000) in acknowledging Texaco’s culpability in the generated environmental damage. (Chevron/Texaco Case, 2014).  

The generation of petrodollars also encouraged Western banks to offer easy credit to the Ecuadorian government (Pablo & Andrade, 2016, p. 124). However, the decline in Ecuador’s petroleum boom by the mid-1980s and the sharp hike in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve in 1979 left Ecuador unable to service its debts, resulting in the greater Latin America Debt Crisis. When turned to for loans, the IMF demanded the implementation of neo-liberal policies, such as cutting government spending, opening the economy to foreign investors, lowering tariffs and raising taxes. (Endrizzi et al., 2023, p. 234). It can be argued that the IMF’s interest was to ensure Ecuador’s ability to repay its loans to the IMF and the Western commercial banks, with whom the IMF shared a close relationship (Ocampo, 2014, p. 21).

Ecuador’s compliance with IMF demands have hurt the Ecuadorian population in the late 1980s to early 1990s, as the cost of basic necessities rose with decreasing minimum wages. (Endrizzi et al., 2023, p. 224). In the meantime, the privatisation of Ecuador’s state companies and national resources allowed international capital to acquire them at low valuations (Endrizzi et al., 2023, p. 234).

A US financial aid and loan package was also set up in 1961 for Latin America, with the program dubbed the ‘Alliance for Progress’. However, this program came with strings attached. In return for US financial aid and loans, Latin American countries were expected to create comprehensive plans for national development, which would be reviewed and approved by an inter-American board of experts. The countries were also expected to establish democratic governments that could promote political stability and protect human rights. These thereby granted the US a degree of intervention in Latin American governments, serving US goals of ensuring influence over Latin America during a time of potential Soviet influence encroachment in the region. (Dunne, 2013, p. 1391).  

The West’s past actions in Ecuador thus open it up to much the same criticism they have directed against the BRI. It can be argued that Western companies like Texaco have likewise exploited Ecuador’s natural resources while ignoring and refusing culpability for their environmental impacts. The IMF's fiscal, monetary, and foreign investment policy advice can be argued to be made to ensure Ecuador’s ability to generate fiscal surpluses to pay back international capital whilst disregarding the impact of austerity policies on Ecuador’s population. Such advice can also be said to foster a pattern of public borrowing that perpetuated financial dependence, resulting in the 1980 Latin America debt crisis. This economic leverage was also parlayed into interference in the sovereignty of Latin American countries, as demonstrated by the Alliance for Progress program.
