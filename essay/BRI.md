# The Belt and Road Initiative

## What is China’s BRI?  

China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a gigantic plan for a global network of roads, ports, railways, and other infrastructure to connect China to the world. The BRI can be thought of as a massive trade network and a political vision. What started out in 2013 was an idea to invest in infrastructure from China through Central Asia, Europe and Africa. But over the years, it has become something much larger. It is now a colossal project scheduled to involve 60% of the world's population. The BRI weaves together lots of projects of all scales. It could be China building things from scratch, upgrading existing infrastructure, handing out loans or making investments (Geostrata, 2022).  

Overland routes form the “belt,” connecting China to Central and South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. The belt also includes the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, where around $60 billion is being spent on coal and hydro plants, wind farms, highways, and a new high-speed rail link between Peshawar and Karachi.
The “road” portion, which has a rather confusing nomenclature, refers to the maritime Silk Road of sea routes connecting China to Southeast Asia, Africa, and Europe. These sea routes create opportunities for investments in ports worldwide, in places like Sri Lanka, Dubai, Djibouti, Greece, Spain, and even South America. There are countless initiatives, and the Belt and Road has been adapted as a label to capture what is happening. 
Although there is no definite definition and list of what projects contribute to the BRI, it is estimated to include 2600 projects in more than 100 countries. This makes it hard to formulate an accurate valuation of the initiative. Still, it has been predicted that China’s overall expenses over the duration of the initiative could reach 1.3 trillion dollars by 2027.

## China’s Goals

For China, the BRI is centred around creating new trade and economic development opportunities. What inspires the BRI is the need to transfer industrial overcapacity from China and find new markets for Chinese goods and services. It strategically secures critical supply chains and new markets for China, especially regarding energy resources, and thus deals with its challenge of gaining geopolitical influence. Most investment in BRI projects comes from Chinese policy banks, with the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank providing massive loans and investments issued to the recipient countries (Spot the Difference: Comparing the Belt Road Initiative and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment | Global Development Policy Center, 2022)  

However, with the push for global interconnectedness and the tremendous amount of money involved, the BRI is inevitably also a political concern. With infrastructure construction worldwide, China exports its own version of economic development. Compared to the West, which usually provides economic support with strings attached, China's goal is to support infrastructure eagerly. China’s motivation to create secure trading routes by inviting countries to join the initiative has led to China financing and investing in countries open for mutual benefits.  

However, the BRI is primarily met with scepticism and criticism, mainly from Western countries. There is a question about the many BRI projects' economic feasibility or sustainability, whether they can create potentially unsustainable debt burdens on participating countries, and their environmental and social impacts. There are also concerns that the BRI is a way for China to gain economic and political influence on a global scale, with the possibility of undermining the sovereignty of the countries to which it will lend funds and create dependencies that will be to the advantage of China's strategic interests.  

In this respect, for a critical assessment of the BRI and understanding the reasons behind Western scepticism, it would be essential to apply diverse theoretical concepts from international development studies. Concepts like technological determinism, governmentality, high modernist governance, and the Orientalist lens are appropriate frameworks to examine the complexities and controversies around the BRI. The specific case study of BRI linked to Ecuador with the construction of the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project provides pathways for looking at how the theoretical apparatus of these frameworks explains the divergent views on the BRI and its implications for global development.  

The Belt and Road Initiative is a path-breaking vision for global trade and development, potentially transforming economic relationships and ushering in new levels of cooperation. Concurrently, it harbours challenges and risks associated with debt sustainability, environmental impact, and geopolitics. Understanding these complexities through different theoretical perspectives must allow for a more robust critique of the BRI and the multifaceted nature of global developmental attempts in the 21st century.

# Why do countries take part in the BRI?

A key attribute of the BRI is large scale infrastructure development in the partner countries. Partner countries often join the BRI to obtain the funding and expertise that they lack for their large scale infrastructure projects. However, this yields two further questions. First, given their own lack of capability, why do countries still wish to undertake large scale infrastructural development? Secondly, why do partner countries now look to the BRI to obtain financing instead of traditional sources such as the World Bank, the IMF or USAID?  

## The Appeal of Large Scale Infrastructure  

Of the over 150 signatory countries to the BRI, the majority are considered Developing Countries who joined to obtain funding and expertise to build large infrastructure projects. Common reasons cited for building large scale infrastructure include the improvement in productivity by ensuring sufficient energy supply, enhancing connectivity or reducing transportation costs. Infrastructural projects are also built in response to rapid urbanisation in cities that require growth in infrastructure to ensure living conditions in such urban context. Large scale infrastructure works are also cited to generate growth in the local economy by offering jobs. (Srinivasu, 2013). All these are often packaged together in the idea of nation-building, economic progress and modernization.  

Yet, this idea of building infrastructure for development is a relatively recent idea for much of the world. The Industrial Revolution of the late 18th to early 19th century marked the beginning of large-scale infrastructure projects. But it was this industrialization, with the accordingly drastic increase in output and scientific progress that played a chief role in allowing industrialised countries like that of Britain or France to begin their process of colonization.  

In Latin America, the large-scale infrastructure boom was not to be witnessed until the 1950s onwards, when Latin American countries became newly independent. However, these newly independent countries felt themselves underdeveloped and insecure when compared to that of the developed states of their former colonial masters. State leaders felt that material growth and development was key to international recognition and rights. Industrialization and the development of infrastructure was accordingly linked to nationalism and promoted as one. (Doyle, 2014, p.101).  

Infrastructure projects are also highly visible, and are oftentimes viewed by political leaders as a means to gain prestige and demonstrate progress to domestic and international spectators. Accordingly, infrastructural and engineering projects became the ambition of developing countries, an ambition that persists till this day.  

## Why look to the BRI for financing

The ambition of developing countries are oftentimes hampered by the lack of financing. For much of the later half of the 20th century and the early 2000s, the largest sources of funding for national infrastructure projects in Latin America came from multilateral development banks like the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (About the IDB, n.d.), both of whom the US has significant influence in. For regions like Southeast Asia, the Asian Development Bank plays a role similar to the World Bank, with Japan and the US possessing a significant influence. When in need of financing, the IMF often served as the lender of last resort, though its loans often came with conditions of state reforms.  

Borrowing from these institutions often came with lengthy approval processes. Proposed projects by countries might also meet with refusal or conditions that were unpalatable to the proposing countries. (Leahy, 2023) In the case of borrowing from the IMF or USAID, loans often came with prescriptions of neoliberal reforms, austerity measures and other political or policy reform requirements which could be unpopular with the borrowing nations.  

The BRI champions “win-win” policies grounded on the premise that the BRI recognises traditional definitions of sovereignty and non-interference as much as that of the BRI’s sponsor, the PRC. Borrowing from the BRI thus came with the promise of no political or economic interference in domestic affairs, a promise that appealed to many countries such as those in Latin America. (Piccone, 2016, p.5).  

The BRI also has demonstrated a willingness to fund projects that the Western-dominated institutions do not on grounds of environmental concerns, governance and financial viability. An often cited example is the troubled Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, whose development proposal was rejected by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank before being funded by the Export-Import Bank of China. Another is that of Ecuador’s Coca Codo Sinclair dam, which did not receive funding from typical sources such as the World Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank, instead being eventually funded by the Export-Import Bank of China as well.
