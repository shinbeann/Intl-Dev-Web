# The Belt and Road Initiative

## What is China’s BRI?  

China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a gigantic plan for a global network of roads, ports, railways, and other infrastructure to connect China to the world. The BRI can be thought of as a massive trade network and a political vision. What started out in 2013 was an idea to invest in infrastructure from China through Central Asia, Europe and Africa. But over the years, it has become something much larger. It is now a colossal project scheduled to involve 60% of the world's population. The BRI weaves together lots of projects of all scales. It could be China building things from scratch, upgrading existing infrastructure, handing out loans or making investments (Geostrata, 2022).  

Overland routes form the “belt,” connecting China to Central and South Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. The belt also includes the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, where around $60 billion is being spent on coal and hydro plants, wind farms, highways, and a new high-speed rail link between Peshawar and Karachi.
The “road” portion, which has a rather confusing nomenclature, refers to the maritime Silk Road of sea routes connecting China to Southeast Asia, Africa, and Europe. These sea routes create opportunities for investments in ports worldwide, in places like Sri Lanka, Dubai, Djibouti, Greece, Spain, and even South America. There are countless initiatives, and the Belt and Road has been adapted as a label to capture what is happening. 
Although there is no definite definition and list of what projects contribute to the BRI, it is estimated to include 2600 projects in more than 100 countries. This makes it hard to formulate an accurate valuation of the initiative. Still, it has been predicted that China’s overall expenses over the duration of the initiative could reach 1.3 trillion dollars by 2027.

## China’s Goals

For China, the BRI is centred around creating new trade and economic development opportunities. What inspires the BRI is the need to transfer industrial overcapacity from China and find new markets for Chinese goods and services. It strategically secures critical supply chains and new markets for China, especially regarding energy resources, and thus deals with its challenge of gaining geopolitical influence. Most investment in BRI projects comes from Chinese policy banks, with the Export-Import Bank of China and the China Development Bank providing massive loans and investments issued to the recipient countries (Spot the Difference: Comparing the Belt Road Initiative and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment | Global Development Policy Center, 2022)  

However, with the push for global interconnectedness and the tremendous amount of money involved, the BRI is inevitably also a political concern. With infrastructure construction worldwide, China exports its own version of economic development. Compared to the West, which usually provides economic support with strings attached, China's goal is to support infrastructure eagerly. China’s motivation to create secure trading routes by inviting countries to join the initiative has led to China financing and investing in countries open for mutual benefits.  

However, the BRI is primarily met with scepticism and criticism, mainly from Western countries. There is a question about the many BRI projects' economic feasibility or sustainability, whether they can create potentially unsustainable debt burdens on participating countries, and their environmental and social impacts. There are also concerns that the BRI is a way for China to gain economic and political influence on a global scale, with the possibility of undermining the sovereignty of the countries to which it will lend funds and create dependencies that will be to the advantage of China's strategic interests.  

In this respect, for a critical assessment of the BRI and understanding the reasons behind Western scepticism, it would be essential to apply diverse theoretical concepts from international development studies. Concepts like technological determinism, governmentality, high modernist governance, and the Orientalist lens are appropriate frameworks to examine the complexities and controversies around the BRI. The specific case study of BRI linked to Ecuador with the construction of the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project provides pathways for looking at how the theoretical apparatus of these frameworks explains the divergent views on the BRI and its implications for global development.  

The Belt and Road Initiative is a path-breaking vision for global trade and development, potentially transforming economic relationships and ushering in new levels of cooperation. Concurrently, it harbours challenges and risks associated with debt sustainability, environmental impact, and geopolitics. Understanding these complexities through different theoretical perspectives must allow for a more robust critique of the BRI and the multifaceted nature of global developmental attempts in the 21st century.

# Why do countries take part in the BRI?

A key attribute of the BRI is large scale infrastructure development in the partner countries. Partner countries often join the BRI to obtain the funding and expertise that they lack for their large scale infrastructure projects. However, this yields two further questions. First, given their own lack of capability, why do countries still wish to undertake large scale infrastructural development? Secondly, why do partner countries now look to the BRI to obtain financing instead of traditional sources such as the World Bank, the IMF or USAID?  

## The Appeal of Large Scale Infrastructure  

Of the over 150 signatory countries to the BRI, the majority are considered Developing Countries who joined to obtain funding and expertise to build large infrastructure projects. Common reasons cited for building large scale infrastructure include the improvement in productivity by ensuring sufficient energy supply, enhancing connectivity or reducing transportation costs. Infrastructural projects are also built in response to rapid urbanisation in cities that require growth in infrastructure to ensure living conditions in such urban context. Large scale infrastructure works are also cited to generate growth in the local economy by offering jobs. (Srinivasu, 2013). All these are often packaged together in the idea of nation-building, economic progress and modernization.  

Yet, this idea of building infrastructure for development is a relatively recent idea for much of the world. The Industrial Revolution of the late 18th to early 19th century marked the beginning of large-scale infrastructure projects. But it was this industrialization, with the accordingly drastic increase in output and scientific progress that played a chief role in allowing industrialised countries like that of Britain or France to begin their process of colonization.  

In Latin America, the large-scale infrastructure boom was not to be witnessed until the 1950s onwards, when Latin American countries became newly independent. However, these newly independent countries felt themselves underdeveloped and insecure when compared to that of the developed states of their former colonial masters. State leaders felt that material growth and development was key to international recognition and rights. Industrialization and the development of infrastructure was accordingly linked to nationalism and promoted as one. (Doyle, 2014, p.101).  

Infrastructure projects are also highly visible, and are oftentimes viewed by political leaders as a means to gain prestige and demonstrate progress to domestic and international spectators. Accordingly, infrastructural and engineering projects became the ambition of developing countries, an ambition that persists till this day.  

## Why look to the BRI for financing

The ambition of developing countries are oftentimes hampered by the lack of financing. For much of the later half of the 20th century and the early 2000s, the largest sources of funding for national infrastructure projects in Latin America came from multilateral development banks like the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (About the IDB, n.d.), both of whom the US has significant influence in. For regions like Southeast Asia, the Asian Development Bank plays a role similar to the World Bank, with Japan and the US possessing a significant influence. When in need of financing, the IMF often served as the lender of last resort, though its loans often came with conditions of state reforms.  

Borrowing from these institutions often came with lengthy approval processes. Proposed projects by countries might also meet with refusal or conditions that were unpalatable to the proposing countries. (Leahy, 2023) In the case of borrowing from the IMF or USAID, loans often came with prescriptions of neoliberal reforms, austerity measures and other political or policy reform requirements which could be unpopular with the borrowing nations.  

The BRI champions “win-win” policies grounded on the premise that the BRI recognises traditional definitions of sovereignty and non-interference as much as that of the BRI’s sponsor, the PRC. Borrowing from the BRI thus came with the promise of no political or economic interference in domestic affairs, a promise that appealed to many countries such as those in Latin America. (Piccone, 2016, p.5).  

The BRI also has demonstrated a willingness to fund projects that the Western-dominated institutions do not on grounds of environmental concerns, governance and financial viability. An often cited example is the troubled Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, whose development proposal was rejected by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank before being funded by the Export-Import Bank of China. Another is that of Ecuador’s Coca Codo Sinclair dam, which did not receive funding from typical sources such as the World Bank or the Inter-American Development Bank, instead being eventually funded by the Export-Import Bank of China as well.

# Evaluating Criticisms of the BRI

As mentioned previously, the BRI's main objectives were to improve global trade and stimulate economic growth. The following section will explore whether some of these allegations were true. 
growth by building infrastructure and expanding trade links between Asia, Africa and Europe. However, China’s BRI faced much criticism from Western countries, including allegations of debt-trap diplomacy, lack of transparency, environmental concerns and geopolitical motives.  

## Debt-trap Diplomacy

Debt trap diplomacy describes a situation in which a powerful country, such as China, extends extensive credit to a borrowing nation, usually for infrastructure or development projects, intending to trap the country in debt. Are Western countries' allegations that China used debt trap diplomacy to further its national interests true?  

**True:**   
Through BRI, China could own and control key logistics hubs crucial to the global community. China was criticised for intentionally lending more than the borrower can repay. In the case of Ecuador, China distributed approximately $138 billion in loans to the region, including Brazil and Venezuela (Person, 2023). Ecuador became dependent on China’s loans, with USD$3.8 billion used for financial needs. Considering how Ecuador still owed China all it had borrowed, Ecuador committed to delivering 1325 barrels of oil by 2024 to China, which was 5 times more than what was initially required to cover the debt (Person, 2023). This is a clear example of China’s debt trap diplomacy, with China gaining a strategic foothold in getting the resources it needs from Ecuador. Through this example, we can analyse how China put on a facade of wanting to help other countries out but used their weak economies and limited bargaining power to seize strategic assets.  

**Not True:**   
It is arguable that labelling BRI as a 'debt trap' is not based on factual evidence and is an exaggerated claim. This is primarily because many countries are already burdened with escalating debt, and their indebtedness to China constitutes only a minor portion of their overall liabilities (Hong, 2023). For instance, Pakistan grappled with substantial external debt and fiscal deficits before engaging in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Despite its high debt levels, Pakistan chose to participate in the CPEC, a prominent BRI undertaking comprising numerous infrastructure and energy projects. The main aim of CPEC was to improve the connectivity between Pakistan’s Gwadar Port and the Xinjiang region in China. Pakistan deemed it necessary for CPEC to allow for long-term development that would help ease its economic burden (Lindley 2022). Furthermore, Western nations cannot accuse China of trapping debt, considering that most countries are well aware of the financial implications of participating in the BRI, as demonstrated by Pakistan's case. These countries can accept or decline loans from China; therefore, condemning China for purported debt trapping is unjust.  

Is it truly justifiable for Western nations to criticise China for engaging in debt trapping? Upon closer examination, it becomes evident that Western nations have been deeply entrenched in neocolonialism for an extensive period. The West has been the major hindrance to the economic development of multiple African countries. A compelling illustration is the case of Ethiopia’s Arabica coffee, which farmers sell for as little as $4 per kilogram. Still, large coffee corporations earn about $200 per kilogram, allowing them to earn millions (Cherneva, 2020). Thus, by using slave labour, Western countries can develop themselves economically. This renders them hypocritical for disparaging China for purported debt trapping when they effectively pursue similar objectives.  

## Environmental Concerns  

Western countries also accused BRI Projects of frequently bypassing environmental regulations.  

**True:**  
China was prioritising economic developments over environmental concerns. Despite agreeing to make BRI more sustainable by reducing emissions and protecting diversity, China was seen to be doing the opposite. For example, Ecuador is a country that takes climate change very seriously, with 98.6% of its population concerned. China, however, ranks last on this list, with only 36.1% of the population concerned about climate change (McSweeney, 2016). This indifferent attitude from China can be observed when Ecuador pleaded with six banks in China to reconsider their financing for mining projects (such as the Mirador project) in Ecuador, only to be met with silence (Hill, 2020). This proves that China did not intend to make BRI a more green plan as its economic growth was more aligned with its national interests. However, with environmental concerns more aligned with global interests, what China is doing allows the allegations by Western countries to remain true.

**Not True:**  
China tried to shift its BRI practices to be more environmentally friendly. There was a greater use of renewable energy, equivalent to 750 million tonnes of standard coal. This allowed carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced by 2.1 billion tonnes (Khalid, 2023). With figures as large as the ones mentioned, it is impossible to say that China did not care about environmental concerns. On top of shifting to renewable energy, China is recognised as a global leader in producing electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines (Khalid, 2023). Thus, although China could do more to make BRI green, it would be unfair to say there was no effort.  

Similar to the debt-trap diplomacy, the allegations from the Western countries may not be valid. Many Western countries still have a high per capita carbon footprint and contribute significantly to global pollution. According to the European Environment Agency (EEA), air pollution is a significant problem in Europe with detrimental effects, with approximately 48,000 deaths in France yearly (Igini, 2024). Additionally, in Europe alone, about 26 million tonnes of plastic waste is produced yearly (Igini, 2024). These are just two issues out of the many. Thus, with such negative consequences as the ones mentioned, it is ironic for Western countries to accuse China of not caring about the environment.  

In conclusion, the West saw multiple aspects of the BRI in a negative light. However, whether or not these accusations were valid to be pointed out by these countries is an entirely different story.
