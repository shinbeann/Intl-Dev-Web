                <p style="text-align: left;">Tucked away in the Napo Province of Ecuador's Amazon rainforest, 
                    the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydropower Project (CCSHP) stands as a grand 
                    symbol of ambition and, unfortunately, controversy. What was once 
                    predicted to be a triumphant testament to China’s Belt and Road Initiative 
                    (BRI), an aspiring international project aimed to rekindle global 
                    trade and infrastructure, the dam has instead been targeted by critics 
                    as a failed gambit (Radomski, 2024).

                    <br><br>
                    Towering above as the largest hydroelectric dam in the country, the 
                    CCSHP dam serves as a stark reminder of the necessary planning that is 
                    required for developmental projects. The dam was destined to be the crown 
                    jewel of China’s investment into South America, with the goal of generating 
                    20-30% of Ecuador’s electricity (Power Technology, 2020). As of March 2024, 
                    the CCSHP is currently supplying an enormous 40% of Ecuador’s electricity 
                    production (Radomski, 2024). Sinohydro built the hydroelectric plant, which 
                    is currently the largest in the country, at a cost of around US$3.4bn while 
                    Ecuador invested an additional US$600mn for the required transmission lines 
                    (Power Technology, 2020).

                    <br><br>
                    The CCSHP was constructed as a reaction to the previous market-based government, 
                    or as former President Rafael Correa called it, the 30-year “long and dark night 
                    of neoliberalism”. The dam was built within the framework of Correa’s “Citizen 
                    Revolution” (Revolución Ciudadana) political programme. The program is structured 
                    around the idea of “good living,” or Buen Vivir (Teräväinen, 2019). A foundational 
                    part of this shift in policy includes a transition towards diversified energy sources 
                    as part of The Electricity Master Plan, increasing national energy security whilst
                    playing a part in climate change mitigation (Ponce-Jara et al., 2018). With a new 
                    approach motivated by development, climate mitigation, conservation, and resource 
                    nationalism, the focus on renewable energy sources accelerated the adoption of energy 
                    solutions, leading to the construction of the CCSHP as the centerpiece of this plan, 
                    as well as seven other hydropower projects. These hydropower projects are geared to 
                    increase hydropower from 58% of electricity generation in 2015 to 90% in the future 
                    years (Teräväinen, 2019). However, recent policy measures, such as new oil field 
                    concessions, have contradicted this transition towards climate change mitigation. 
                    Furthermore, significant Chinese loans and investments, such as those made to finance 
                    the CCSHP, have restricted resource nationalism, which questions the legitimacy 
                    of the policies in giving nature its own rights, and the preservation of the environment.
                
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the potential benefits of the CCSHP dam in terms of boosting electricity supply, 
                    decreasing reliance on thermoelectric plants, and mitigating greenhouse gasses, concerns 
                    persist regarding its lasting impact and viability. The absence of thorough technical, 
                    social, and environmental assessments from the project's outset has hampered plant construction
                    and operation,  leading to multiple construction scandals, permanent environmental harm 
                    and social conflicts in the river basin.

                <h2>Quality Scandal</h2>
                    <p  id="text"> Following its launch in November 2019, the plant has been surrounded 
                        by international controversy, specifically questions regarding the materials' quality and the 
                        appearance of thousands of fissures within the plant's distributors that connect water to the 
                        turbines to generate electricity. Not long after its construction, workers and engineers in the 
                        plant uncovered an alarming amount of cracks within the dam's piping system. The presence of these 
                        defects catalysed a deeper investigation into the quality of the construction materials used in 
                        making the dam, questioning the building standards of Sinohydro. 2018, after two years of CCSHP 
                        operation, 171 unaddressed defects by Sinohydro were found. Additionally, 7,648 cracks and micro 
                        fissures were found in the water distributors in the plant's machinery room. A final report in 2019 
                        indicated that the cracks resulted from Sinohydro's use of unauthorised materials and their failure 
                        to follow proper technical procedures for welding the identified faults in 2014 (The People's Map 
                        of Global China, 2022)

                        <br><br>
                        Before the launch, the project also suffered from multiple technical difficulties. In December 2014, 
                        25 workers stood on a temporary platform when an avalanche of water and construction material burst 
                        through the pipe. The platform gave way and fell, killing 13 people (13 Ecuadorians and 3 Chinese) 
                        and injuring another 12 (Times, n.d.). In 2018, three of the eight-generation units were not 
                        operational due to significant disconnections in the system. Furthermore, multiple Ecuadorian cities 
                        experienced power outages due to transmission line outages, and the shortfall in electricity 
                        had to be made up for by two other dams (Minas San Francisco and Delsitanisagua).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Environmental Degradation</h2>
                    <p  id="text"> Moreover, the CCSHP has brought about numerous environmental threats, 
                        such as heavy erosion events, changes in ecological water flows, and the drying up of Ecuador’s 
                        famous San Rafael waterfall. Environmental specialists and geologists warned that the project’s 
                        over-dimensions and lack of comprehensive accountability for the surrounding environment would 
                        severely impact the local ecosystem. Critics raised concerns about the project’s ability to 
                        deliver the promised energy production, especially since the river has a lower flow rate than 
                        anticipated, coupled with sedimentation and seismic risks. The project is also faulted for
                         impacting the last intact roadless zone in the Tropical Andes and the UNESCO Sumaco Biosphere 
                         Reserve. Due to the project's construction, new roads and transport infrastructure will require 
                         the further deforestation of surrounding land, leading to further environmental degradation. 
                         In February 2020, the collapse of the San Rafael Waterfall was attributed to accelerated 
                         regressive erosion in the Coca River, which inadvertently altered the behaviour of the natural 
                         dynamics of the Coca River (Hoffner, 2020). Coupled with increasingly intense and expansive 
                         anthropogenic activities in the region, the regressive erosion escalated, leading to the 
                         unfortunate loss of roads, bridges, housing complexes and infrastructure in strategic sectors 
                         (Ecuador’s most spectacular waterfall threatened by Chinese-funded Hydroelectric Project, n.d.). 

                         <br><br>
                         Furthermore, scientists are concerned about the effects that the erosive processes could 
                         have on the local freshwater fish and macroinvertebrates. According to the IUCN Red List of 
                         endangered species, many of the river’s species have been lost in the last 30 years and are facing 
                         further endangerment due to the construction of the CCSHP. This also impacts the locals, who 
                         depend on fish for their protein. The absence of fish in the river could lead to the hunting of 
                         monkeys for separate food sources (Lievano, 2023).
                    </p>


                        <h2>Social Conflict</h2>
                        <p id="text">Unlike other mega-dam projects, the CCSHP did not lead to the 
                            displacement of locals or the infringement of indigenous rights. Nonetheless, that is not to 
                            say that no social issues were reported. The dam's construction has indirectly impacted the 
                            local communities and their daily needs. Due to the dam's erosive effects and the diversion 
                            of the river’s flow, the locals are facing declining agricultural production, livestock, 
                            and fishing activities.

                            <br><br>
                            Despite creating employment opportunities at the power plant and boosting the local economy 
                            during the dam's construction, the CCSHP's economic sustainability is questionable. Once the dam 
                            became fully operational with construction works completed, the local economy experienced a 
                            slowdown, and unemployment in the region increased (The People’s Map of Global China, 2022). 

                            <br><br>
                            Following this, the Ecuadorian Government provided aid by compensating the locals and spurring 
                            local development through various small-scale projects. These included “training and employment 
                            programs, electrification works, sewerage services, waste treatment, education and employment programs” 
                            (The People’s Map of Global China, 2022). However, critics argue that the government could do more
                             with the remaining budget allocated for these programs, with potential comprehensive development 
                             projects that would bring about direct economic impacts not being fulfilled.
